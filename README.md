# TransformingOperators
This project is the fifth part of a series of 10 articles about RxJava operators. It contains some examples of operators that are used to tranform items emitted from the source into another items prior to emit them downstream.

Here is a list of all operators available in this project:

  - buffer(w/count)
  - buffer(w/timespan)
  - buffer(w/count and timespan)
  - buffer(w/timespan and timeshift)
  - buffer(w/boundary)
  - buffer(w/selectors)
  - window(w/count and timespan)
  - scan()
  - scan(w/seed)

Please, refer to [this article](http://androidahead.com/2017/11/16/rxjava-operators-part-5-transforming-operators/) for detailed information.
